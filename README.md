## a language pre compiler
### php5.6

Temple is a language pre compiler which started out as an object oriented programming template engine.
Now you can implement thousands of different languages in your project and run them trough one variable scope.

Since i only can work on this part time, i appreciate any suggestion you might have.
If you'r nuts enough you can even write a Language implementation for your favourite programming language.
