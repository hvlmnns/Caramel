# What is Temple?

Temple is a **language engine** which enables you to use any file as a template in your php framework.  
   
The initial main goal was to create a template engine which get rid of all the problems i encountered on some other engines i used. 
I ended up creating a system where you can write your own language support with a breeze.

Since all templates run trough the same compiler, you'll have access to the variable scope within every file.
